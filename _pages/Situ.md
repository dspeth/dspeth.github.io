Fieldsites and fieldwork.  

### Teaching
{% include gallery caption="Impressions of fieldwork during the international geobiology course." %}
Most of my experience teaching fieldwork has come from my role as one of the lead TAs for the 
[International Geobiology Course](http://web.gps.caltech.edu/GBcourse/) (or GeoBio course for short) from 2017 to 2019. 
The 2020 course was cancelled due to the COVID19 pandemic.  
This five-week intensive course is currently run by Prof. Alex Sessions, Prof. Victoria Orphan, and Prof. Woody Fischer, professors in geobiology at Caltech.
During the course, students get a taste of fieldwork with a focus on (micro)biology and/or geology on a ~10 day field trip. 
The field sites with more emphasis on (micro)biology the course visited during my tenure as TA included Mono Lake, 
the hot springs of Little Hot Creek, and the tar seeps of sulfur mountain.
My involvement in the GeoBio course has been one of the most rewarding experiences of my time at Caltech.
