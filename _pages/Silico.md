Highlights of my involvement in bioinformatics teaching and research.  
Work in progress.

### Teaching  
  
**BVCN**  
The [Bioinformatics Vicrtual Coordination Network](https://biovcnet.github.io/) (BVCN) is a community driven effort 
started by [Dr. Ben Tully](https://bjtully.github.io/) during the shutdown of many research institutes in the United Stated during the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020.
The BVCN provides a slack channel where learners (and instructors) can ask questions of, and discuss approaches/tools with, more than 600 members. 
In addition, the [BVCN instructors](https://biovcnet.github.io/_pages/people/) release video tutorials on the [BVCN Youtube channel](youtube.com/channel/UC5qVqcvUPfgPQWOhBaR_Low).
Thus far, I have contributed videos on metagenomic binning [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4T1xwO9yvI&list=PL4K-daRUS2A9kPIMSuEIOODwt5YK3OMuv) 
and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9U0uTFRsl4&list=PL4K-daRUS2A9kPIMSuEIOODwt5YK3OMuv).
  
**Brief History of Metagenomics**  
I have co-taught a seminar course with Prof. Victoria Orphan, 
loosely based on the introduction chapter 1.1 of [my PhD thesis](https://repository.ubn.ru.nl/bitstream/handle/2066/151711/151711.pdf).
The course covered conceptual and technological advances leading up to the metagenomics boom of today.
Outlining the course content here would take up a bit too much space, but will be the subject of a separate post, which I'll link here.
  
  
### Research 
  
**Genomes from Metagenomes**  
Our ability to recover genomes from environmental samples, through metagenomics and single cell based approaches, has tranformed our view of microbial diversity.  
In addition, it has shed new light on the phylogenetic distribution and evolution of microbial metabolisms, such as methanogenesis.
As a graduate student, I was an early adopter of genome resolved metagenomics, 
resulting in more genomic information on organisms capable of anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox bacteria). 
In addition, a [community-wide analysis](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms11172) of an anammox reactor in the main line of a Dutch wastewater treatment plant 
provided hypotheses for interactions of anammox bacteria and other nitrogen cycling organisms in these important systems. 
Ongoing work in this area includes environmental metagenomics of extreme environments, such as a hydrothermal vent system and an alkaline soda lake.
