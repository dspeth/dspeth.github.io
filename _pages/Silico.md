Highlights of my involvement in bioinformatics teaching and research.  
Work in progress.

### Teaching  
  
**BVCN**  
The [Bioinformatics Vicrtual Coordination Network](https://biovcnet.github.io/) (BVCN) is a community driven effort 
started by [Dr. Ben Tully](https://bjtully.github.io/) during the shutdown of many research institutes in the United Stated during the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020.
The BVCN provides a slack channel where learners (and instructors) can ask questions of, and discuss approaches/tools with, more than 600 members. 
In addition, the [BVCN instructors](https://biovcnet.github.io/_pages/people/) release video tutorials on the [BVCN Youtube channel](youtube.com/channel/UC5qVqcvUPfgPQWOhBaR_Low).
Thus far, I have contributed videos on metagenomic binning [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4T1xwO9yvI&list=PL4K-daRUS2A9kPIMSuEIOODwt5YK3OMuv) 
and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9U0uTFRsl4&list=PL4K-daRUS2A9kPIMSuEIOODwt5YK3OMuv).
  
**Brief History of Metagenomics**  
I have co-taught a seminar course with Prof. Victoria Orphan, 
loosely based on the introduction chapter 1.1 of [my PhD thesis](https://repository.ubn.ru.nl/bitstream/handle/2066/151711/151711.pdf).

  
  
### Research
