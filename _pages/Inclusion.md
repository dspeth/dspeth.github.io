title: Science for All

note: I'm slowly adding content to the site, but it is currently a work in progress.  


Beyond the thrill of dicovery and a fascination with microbes, for me personally, a major draw of a career in academia has always been that I feel I can be myself in this community.
This is partly because I am a white man, and partly because my preferred style and bearing fit with stereotypes of what a (micro)biologist (can) look like. 
As I am writing this in July 2020, I have only fairly recently realized what an enormous privilege that feeling is.
From this perspective I am committed to make my communities, scientific and otherwise, as welcoming to all as they have always felt to me.  
   
I'm well aware that this will only be possible through ongoing effort and conversations, and welcome anyone to reach out.
