The links on this page are a mixed bag of things I enjoy, find useful, or that have impacted my life one way or another, presented in no particular order. 

### Science  
On this site I use and discuss several resources that help me think about the microbial world. Here are the ones I use most heavily, with a brief description of each:

**GTDB**  
When thinking about the microbial world and its staggering diversity, having a framework to put all these tiny organisms in is incredibly helpful.
The tree of life has long been a major organizing priciple of biology, 
and the [Genome Taxonomy DataBase](https://gtdb.ecogenomic.org/) (GTDB) is an ongoing effort to use modern genome data to provide a consistent organization of Bacteria and Archaea.  
For those of you who, like me, have a hard time keeping track of clades getting renamed check out their [taxon history tool](https://gtdb.ecogenomic.org/taxon_history/).
  
**iToL**  
Visualizing phylogenetic trees, whether representing organism evolution or relationships within protein families, is a core part of biological science. 
The [Interactive Tree of Life](https://itol.embl.de/) (iToL) provides the a great way of viewing and customizing phylogenies. 
Be sure to check out their [tree annotation options](https://itol.embl.de/help.cgi#annot)!  
After years of being a free resource, rising maintenance cost forced iToL to transition to a [subsciption model](https://itol.embl.de/infoReg.cgi?f=a) in October 2020.

### Society 


### Rugby
I've started playing rugby relatively late in life, while working on an internship at MIT I joined [MIT Rugby](http://rugby.mit.edu/). 
This was the first time I lived and worked in another country, and the rugby team was a big part of making that time and amazing experience. 
When returning home for graduate school, I searched out [NSRV Obelix](http://www.nsrvobelix.nl/) in my hometown of Nijmegen, where i slowly got the hang of the game.
The mix of grit and camaraderie you find in a rugby team make rugby a wonderful sport, especially if you find yourself moving to different countries.
Finally, after moving to Pasadena for a PostDoc, I found [Pasadena Rugby](https://www.pasadenarfc.com/), where I still play today.
