<p><b>Welcome!</b></p>
<p>I'm Daan Speth, a (geo)microbiologist and bioinformatician,
currently working as a postdoc in the <a href="http://orphanlab.caltech.edu/">lab of Prof. Victoria Orphan</a> at Caltech.
On this site I highlight some of my work in the lab, the field, and in bioinformatics.
It'll also feature periodic updates on topics that interest me, and has some links that I enjoy, in science and beyond.
And finally, because I really wish science was welcoming to people from all backgrounds that it is in practice,
there's a page featuring some thoughts on that, as well as links to helpful resources.</p>
<p>Note: as of august 2020, adding content here is a work in progress.</p>
