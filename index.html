# Welcome!  
  
I'm Daan Speth, a (geo)microbiologist and bioinformatician,
currently working as a postdoc in the [lab of Prof. Victoria Orphan](http://orphanlab.caltech.edu/) at Caltech.
On this site I highlight some of my work in the lab, the field, and in bioinformatics.
It'll also feature periodic updates on topics that interest me, and has some links that I enjoy, in science and beyond.
And finally, because I really wish science was welcoming to people from all backgrounds that it is in practice,
there's a page featuring some thoughts on that, as well as links to helpful resources.

Note: as of august 2020, adding content here is a work in progress.
