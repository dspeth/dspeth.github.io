<p><b>Welcome!</b></p>


<p class="small">I'm Daan Speth, computational microbiologist and senior scientist at the 
<a href="https://dome.univie.ac.at/">Division of Microbial Ecology</a> of the 
<a href="https://cemess.univie.ac.at/">Centre for Microbiology and Environmental Systems Science</a> at the University of Vienna.
Before landing in Vienna, I have worked as a postdoc in the 
<a href="https://www.mpi-bremen.de/en/Department-of-Biogeochemistry.html">Department of Biogeochemistry</a> 
at the Max Planck Institute for Marine Microbiology in Bremen and the <a href="http://orphanlab.caltech.edu/">Orphan Lab</a> 
at Caltech, and obtained my PhD at the 
<a href="https://www.ru.nl/microbiology/">Department of Microbiology</a> at the Radboud University Nijmegen. </p> 

<p class="small">On this site I highlight some of my work in the lab, in the field, and on our lab server. 
My <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=1xoXn04AAAAJ&hl=en">google scholar profile</a> 
has a more complete, but somewhat dryer, overview of my work.  
This page will also feature periodic updates on topics that interest me and has a page filled with links that I enjoy or find useful, in science and beyond.
And finally, because I really wish science was more welcoming to people from all backgrounds than it is today,
there's a page featuring some thoughts on that, as well as links to helpful resources to go in the right direction.</p>
